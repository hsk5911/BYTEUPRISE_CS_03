# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text messages. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encryption of plaintext messages
- Decryption of ciphertext messages
- User-defined shift value (0 to 25)
- Support for both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Handling of non-alphabetic characters without alteration

## Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `caesar_cipher.py` script using Python.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt and the shift value.

## How it Works

The Caesar Cipher script takes a plaintext message and a shift value as input. It then shifts each letter in the message by the specified number of positions in the alphabet to generate the encrypted message. Decryption works similarly but in reverse.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd caesar-cipher

3. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.


## Usage Example

    python caesar_cipher.py

    Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt when prompted. Then, enter the shift value (an integer between 0 and 25). The script will display the encrypted and decrypted messages based on your input.
